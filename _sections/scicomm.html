  <h3>Public Communication for Researchers: The Start of my Scicomm Story</h3>

  <p>As a wandering first-year Ph.D. student, I attended a talk at the Carnegie Science Center by <a href="https://teaching.pitt.edu/staff-member/john-radzilowicz/">John Radzilowicz</a> about the so-called "war on science." John kept emphasizing that scientists needed to do better as accessible and relatable public communicators. In the Q&amp;A, another grad student said he'd love to&mdash;if only someone would teach him how! That was the moment the <strong><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/student-org/pcr/">Public Communication for Researchers</a></strong> (PCR) program at Carnegie Mellon was born.</p>

  <p>My fellow CMU grad students <strong><a href="https://ardonshorr.com/">Ardon Shorr</a></strong> and <strong>Adona Iosif</strong> joined me in building the program. Over the next few years, we assembled hands-on workshops with communication experts, practice opportunities, and a supportive community of interested students. We started a <a href="https://sciencenonfiction.org/">group blog</a> and hosted two <a href="https://www.storycollider.org/">Story Collider</a> shows. We also pushed for university-run programming of the sort we were offering.</p>

  <p>In the process, we became thoroughly enmeshed in the science communication community.</p>

  <h3>Scicomm Training Work</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In addition to organizing PCR programming, as time went on I taught or co-taught many of the <strong>PCR workshops</strong> myself.</li>
    <li>In 2013, I attended the first-ever national <strong><a href="https://comscicon.com/">ComSciCon conference</a></strong>, a multi-day workshop by and for STEM graduate students invested in science communication. In 2014 and 2015, I came back to serve on the organizing committee. I helped to find and invite speakers and to organize and run hands-on communication training activities for attendees.</li>
    <li>I co-presented several workshops on scientific and technical presentations for the <strong>CMU Alumni Association</strong> (webinars) and the <strong>AAAS Annual Meeting</strong> (conference sessions).</li>
    <li>I co-taught two workshops for participants in the University of Pittsburgh's <strong><a href="http://www.sis.pitt.edu/i3/">iSchool Inclusion Institute</a></strong>.</li>
    <li>I co-presented two workshops for <strong>CMU computer science faculty</strong> on being a public intellectual and talking to the media.</li>
    <li>I taught a workshop on science blogging for graduate botany fellows at <strong>Phipps Conservatory and Botannical Gardens</strong>.</li>
    <li>Beginning in 2018, I have worked part-time with the <strong><a href="https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/">MIT Communication Lab</a></strong>. The program offers peer coaching by STEM graduate students for other students in MIT's engineering departments. I develop the trainings for the peer coaches. I also helped run a study, published in ASEE, evaluating the efficacy of our coaching.</li>
    <li>I am a member of the nascent <strong><a href="https://www.sctn.online/">SciComm Trainers Network</a></strong>. Since October 2019, I have been actively participating in efforts to get the network's activities off the ground.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Science Writing</h3>
  <p>I began blogging and later doing paid freelance work as a Ph.D. student, originally as an outgrowth of ComSciCon and my writings for <a href="https://sciencenonfiction.org/">Science Non-Fiction</a>, PCR's group blog. I have since carved out a niche writing about complex topics in computer science and physics.</p>

  <p>Some of my writing experiences:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In 2017, I was a <strong><a href="https://www.aaas.org/programs/mass-media-fellowship">AAAS Mass Media Fellow</a></strong> at Scientific American.</li>
    <li>After graduating from my Ph.D., I was a Technology, Energy, and Society Fellow at <strong><a href="https://secureenergy.org/">Securing America's Future Energy</a></strong> (SAFE), an energy policy think tank. SAFE sponsored me to write for various outlets about autonomous vehicles.</li>
    <li>I continue to <strong>freelance</strong>, particularly for YouTube outlets such as <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZYTClx2T1of7BRZ86-8fow/">SciShow</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH4BNI0-FOK2dMXoFtViWHw">It's Okay To Be Smart</a></strong>.</li>
    <li>At <strong>Elemental Cognition</strong>, I help craft the company's outward-facing communications, including whitepapers, blog posts, social media, and technical papers.</li>
  </ul>
