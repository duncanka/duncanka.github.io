  <h3>My Scicomm Story</h3>

  <p>As a wandering first-year Ph.D. student, I attended a talk at the Carnegie Science Center by <a href="https://teaching.pitt.edu/staff-member/john-radzilowicz/">John Radzilowicz</a> about the so-called &ldquo;war on science.&rdquo; John kept emphasizing that scientists needed to do better as accessible and relatable public communicators. In the Q&amp;A, another grad student said he&rsquo;d love to&mdash;if only someone would teach him how! That was the moment the <strong><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/student-org/pcr/">Public Communication for Researchers</a></strong> (PCR) program at Carnegie Mellon was born.</p>

  <p>My fellow CMU grad students <strong><a href="https://ardonshorr.com/">Ardon Shorr</a></strong> and <strong>Adona Iosif</strong> joined me in building the training program we wished we&rsquo;d had access to ourselves. We assembled hands-on workshops with communication experts, practice opportunities, and a supportive community of interested students. We started a <a href="https://sciencenonfiction.org/">group blog</a> and hosted two <a href="https://www.storycollider.org/">Story Collider</a> shows. We also pushed for university-run programming of the sort we were offering.</p>

  <p>In the process, we became thoroughly enmeshed in the science communication community.</p>

  <h3>Science Writing</h3>
  <p>Starting in graduate school, I found a niche writing about highly technical topics. Some of my writing experiences:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a href="https://www.aaas.org/programs/mass-media-fellowship">AAAS Mass Media Fellow</a> (2017)</dt>
      <dd>I wrote science news stories, mostly on technology and physics.</dd>
    <dt><a href="https://secureenergy.org/">Securing America&rsquo;s Future Energy</a> (SAFE)</dt>
      <dd>SAFE, an energy policy think tank, sponsored me to write about autonomous vehicles.</dd>
    <dt>Freelance</dt>
      <dd>I freelanced for several years, largely for YouTube outlets like <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZYTClx2T1of7BRZ86-8fow/">SciShow</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH4BNI0-FOK2dMXoFtViWHw">It&rsquo;s Okay To Be Smart</a></strong>.</dd>
    <dt>Elemental Cognition</dt>
      <dd>I helped craft the company&rsquo;s white papers, blog posts, social media, and technical papers.</dd>
