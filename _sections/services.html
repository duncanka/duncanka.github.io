        <div class="itemtext">
          <p>Drawing on my personal experience with AI research, I provide high-level insights about how today's AI tools work, what they're good for, and what they're not so good for. I specialize in making this knowledge accessible and actionable for non-technical professionals.</p>

        </header>
        <div class="itemtext">
          <p>I write stories and video scripts that shed light on key ideas in computer science, math, and physics. Generally these are stories I find myself, but feel free to reach out if there's a story you think I'd like to tell.</p>
          <p>This does <strong>not</strong> include press releases. <strong>Please do not send me press releases.</strong> I do not write stories about products or even generally about individual studies.</p>

          <h3>Science Communication Workshops</h3>
        </header>
        <div class="itemtext">
          <p>I help scientists and engineers become better communicators with each other, the media, and the general public. I've trained graduate students at MIT and Carnegie Mellon, CMU alumni, <a href="https://www.phipps.conservatory.org/green-innovation/for-the-world/botany-in-action">Botany in Action</a> graduate fellows, AAAS Annual Meeting attendees, and even CMU's computer science faculty.</p>
          <p>Possible topics include just about any aspect of communicating about STEM. Example titles: How to be a Science Blogger, Talking to the Media, Crafting Explanatory Metaphors, and Becoming a PowerPoint Wizard.</p>
          <p>Workshops are highly interactive and extensively customized for each audience.</p>
