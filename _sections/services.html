          <h3>Consulting on AI</h3>
        </header>
        <div class="itemtext">
          <p>Drawing on my personal experience with AI research, I provide high-level insights about how today&rsquo;s AI tools work and what they are and aren&rsquo;t good for. I specialize in making this knowledge accessible and actionable for non-technical professionals.</p>
          <p>Past beneficiaries have included <a href="https://madpow.com/">Mad*Pow</a> and <a href="https://icaad.ngo/">ICAAD</a>.</p>

          <h3>Science Writing</h3>
        </header>
        <div class="itemtext">
          <p>I may continue to write pieces that shed light on key ideas in computer science, math, and physics. Generally I find my stories myself, but do <a href="#contact" class="scrolly">reach out</a> if there&rsquo;s a story you think I&rsquo;d like to tell.</p>
          <p>This does <strong>not</strong> include press releases. <strong>Please do not send me press releases.</strong> I do not write stories about products or even generally about individual studies.</p>

          <h3>Science Communication Workshops</h3>
        </header>
        <div class="itemtext">
          <p>I help scientists and engineers become better communicators with each other, the media, and the general public. I&rsquo;ve trained graduate students at MIT and Carnegie Mellon, CMU alumni, <a href="https://www.phipps.conservatory.org/green-innovation/for-the-world/botany-in-action">Botany in Action</a> graduate fellows, AAAS Annual Meeting attendees, and even CMU&rsquo;s computer science faculty.</p>
          <p>Possible topics include any aspect of communicating about STEM. Example titles: How to be a Science Blogger, Talking to the Media, Crafting Explanatory Metaphors, and Becoming a PowerPoint Wizard.</p>
          <p>Workshops are highly interactive and extensively customized for each audience.</p>
